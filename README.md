# Text Improvement Engine README

## Overview

The Text Improvement Engine is a sophisticated tool built with Python, designed to refine and enhance English text by aligning it with a set of predefined "standardized phrases." These phrases represent ideal expressions in various contexts, such as business communication, academic writing, or technical documentation. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the engine evaluates input text, identifies areas for improvement, and suggests more appropriate or standard phrases. This process aims to elevate the quality of the text, making it clearer, more professional, and in line with established standards.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the Text Improvement Engine, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.8 or later**: The programming language used to develop the engine. 
- **pip**: The Python package installer. It will facilitate the installation of the project's dependencies.

### Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the Text Improvement Engine on your system:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Copy the project files to your local machine. Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd text-improvement-engine
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the project's Git repository.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Execute the following command in the terminal to install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:

   platform: linux-64
   ```bash
   conda create --name <env> --file <this file>
   ```

   This command ensures all necessary libraries, such as NLTK and spaCy, are installed in your Python environment, enabling the engine to process and analyze text effectively.

### Running the Application

To analyze text and generate suggestions, use one of the following commands:

- **Analyzing Text from a File**: If you have a text file you want to analyze, run:

  ```bash
  python main.py --file <path-to-input-text-file>
  ```

  Ensure you replace `<path-to-input-text-file>` with the correct path to your file.

- **Direct Text Input**: To directly input text for analysis, simply run:

  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

  and follow the on-screen prompts to input your text.
